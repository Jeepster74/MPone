""very friendly staff."" | while in the area, i wanted to surprise my boys with a go-karting session. unfortunately, the experience was very disappointing. i'm only giving it one star because the track itself is very good and large, but the service is deplorable. from the moment we arrived, there was no clear display of prices or opening hours, which is a serious lack of transparency. furthermore, we were required to buy a €5 annual pass just to go for a single ride, information that wasn't provided beforehand. the setup was very slow, with many delays, and no briefing was given; my son had to request one himself. one of the karts was restricted from the moment we left the pit (my son is 16 years old), which really spoiled the experience. my two sons were mixed in with a group of beginners, leading to numerous collisions and very dangerous situations. there were also 25 people on the track, while the advertised maximum is 20. another incomprehensible point: my 12-year-old son couldn't ride because children's sessions were only available on sundays. this doesn't make much sense when you're there during the week or just passing through. as a result, he was disappointed.  finally, one of the track staff was overwhelmed and expressed his dissatisfaction to his boss, saying it was a complete mess and very dangerous. some riders in the group were going the wrong way or stopping in the middle of the track just to put their balaclavas back on. it's an experience i won't repeat and don't recommend, especially since the boys didn't enjoy it at all, which is a real shame.","https://www.google.com/maps/place/Green+power+karting/@50.4425042,4.4206221,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x47c22f42feae266b:0x2e7d70bf128d45e2!8m2!3d50.4425042!4d4.4206221!16s%2Fg%2F11c2p0d_c1?hl=en&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI2MDExMy4wIKXMDSoKLDEwMDc5MjA2N0gBUAM%3D",http://www.greenpowerkart.be/,11778.85,124.0,BE32,Prov.
